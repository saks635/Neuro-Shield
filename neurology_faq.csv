Question,Answer
What is Alzheimer's disease?,Alzheimer's is a progressive brain disorder that causes memory loss and cognitive decline.
What is an EEG test?,An EEG is a test that detects electrical activity in your brain using electrodes.
What does an MRI detect?,MRI scans help detect abnormalities in soft tissues like the brain.
What causes epilepsy?,"Epilepsy can result from genetic factors, brain injuries, or neurological conditions."
What are the symptoms of epilepsy?,"Symptoms include seizures, confusion, and loss of consciousness."
What does a neurologist do?,"A neurologist diagnoses and treats disorders of the brain, spine, and nerves."
What is neuroplasticity?,Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize and form new neural connections.
What is a CT scan?,"A CT scan uses X-rays to create detailed images of the body, including the brain."
What is dementia?,"Dementia is a group of conditions affecting memory, thinking, and social abilities."
How does Alzheimer’s differ from normal aging?,Alzheimer's involves severe memory loss and cognitive dysfunction beyond typical aging.
What does EEG stand for?,EEG stands for electroencephalogram.
Why is an EEG important in epilepsy?,EEG helps detect abnormal brain activity associated with seizures.
Can MRI detect Alzheimer's?,"Yes, MRI can show brain shrinkage that occurs with Alzheimer’s progression."
What are the stages of Alzheimer’s disease?,"The stages are mild (early), moderate (middle), and severe (late)."
What are generalized seizures?,Generalized seizures affect both sides of the brain.
What is a focal seizure?,A seizure that originates in a specific area of the brain.
Is epilepsy curable?,It is not typically curable but can be managed with treatments.
What are anti-epileptic drugs?,Medications used to control or reduce seizure activity.
What is Parkinson’s disease?,A neurodegenerative disorder affecting movement and balance.
What causes Parkinson’s?,It's caused by the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.
What is a neurotransmitter?,A chemical messenger that carries signals between nerve cells.
What does dopamine do?,"Dopamine helps regulate movement, emotion, and pleasure."
What happens during a seizure?,The brain experiences abnormal bursts of electrical activity.
What triggers seizures?,"Triggers include stress, flashing lights, missed medication, or lack of sleep."
How is epilepsy diagnosed?,"Through clinical evaluation, EEG testing, and brain imaging."
Can EEG detect brain tumors?,Not effectively; MRI or CT scans are better suited.
What is the role of MRI in neurology?,MRI provides detailed images for diagnosing brain and spinal conditions.
What is a silent stroke?,A stroke causing brain damage with no obvious symptoms.
What is an aura in epilepsy?,A warning sign or sensory change before a seizure occurs.
How long do seizures last?,Most last from a few seconds to two minutes.
What is status epilepticus?,A medical emergency involving prolonged or repeated seizures.
Is dementia the same as Alzheimer’s?,Alzheimer’s is a specific type of dementia.
How do CT and MRI differ?,CT uses X-rays; MRI uses magnetic fields for soft tissue imaging.
What is the hippocampus?,A brain region key to memory and learning.
Why is the hippocampus important in Alzheimer’s?,"It is one of the first regions to shrink, leading to memory loss."
What are microglia?,Immune cells in the central nervous system.
What is neuroinflammation?,"Inflammation of the brain or spinal cord, often seen in disease."
What is Lewy body dementia?,Dementia caused by abnormal protein deposits in brain cells.
Can EEG detect sleep disorders?,"Yes, EEG helps diagnose conditions like narcolepsy and sleep apnea."
What is brain plasticity?,The brain’s ability to adapt and reorganize itself.
What is a PET scan?,A scan that detects brain activity using radioactive tracers.
How is Parkinson’s treated?,"With medications, physical therapy, and sometimes brain surgery."
What is deep brain stimulation?,A treatment involving implanted electrodes to regulate brain activity.
What is a neurologic exam?,"An assessment of reflexes, coordination, and mental function."
What is multiple sclerosis?,An autoimmune disease damaging nerve coverings in the CNS.
Can Alzheimer’s be prevented?,"There’s no guarantee, but risk may be reduced through healthy lifestyle."
What is a brain lesion?,An area of abnormal tissue in the brain.
What is cognitive decline?,A gradual loss of memory and thinking ability.
How is MCI different from dementia?,MCI affects memory but doesn’t interfere with daily activities.
What are plaques and tangles?,Protein clumps in the brain associated with Alzheimer’s.
Can epilepsy develop at any age?,"Yes, though it’s more common in children and the elderly."
